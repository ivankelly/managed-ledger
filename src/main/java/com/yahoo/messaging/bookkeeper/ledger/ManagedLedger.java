/**
 * A ManagedLedger it's a superset of a BookKeeper ledger concept.
 * <p>
 * It mimics the concept of an appender log that:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>has a unique name (chosen by clients) by which it can be
 * created/opened/deleted</li>
 * <li>is always writable: if a writer process crashes, a new writer can re-open
 * the ManagedLedger and continue writing into it</li>
 * <li>has multiple persisted consumers (see {@link ManagedCursor}), each of
 * them with an associated position</li>
 * <li>when all the consumers have processed all the entries contained in a
 * Bookkeeper ledger, the ledger is deleted</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Caveats:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A single ManagedLedger can only be open once at any time. Implementation
 * can protect double access from the same VM, but accesses from different
 * machines to the same ManagedLedger need to be avoided through an external
 * source of coordination.</li>
